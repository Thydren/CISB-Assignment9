    <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</h1>
    <p>By not waiting till the last second to do my assignments. It was hard, but I did it!</p>
    <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
    <p>Nothing. Everything is good. Maybe not have people scatter?</p>
    <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
    <p>Yes. I just wanted to learn the basics. Hope I don't have to build websites in the future, but at least I'll have a good understanding.</p>
    <h2>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</h2>
    <p>Since I took the HTML class there was a lot that was the same, but going in depth helped me understand a lot.</p>
